			<h3> Robby Keen</h3>
			<p>Robby is the son of karate sensei Johnny Lawrence and alcoholic Shannon Keene. When Daniel LaRusso entered Robby's life, he was a rule-breaker at first, but he gradually changed his ways. He improved his self-control, acceptance, and anger management. He was the first Miyagi-Do Karate disciple of the new generation, and his friendship with Sam, Daniel's daughter, flourished. His feelings for her sparked a ferocious rivalry with Miguel Diaz, culminating in a fight at West Valley High.</p>

			<h3> Miguel Diaz</h3>
			<p>Miguel is the neighbor of former karate champion Johnny Lawrence, and he convinces Johnny to train him. Miguel helps him reopen and establish a student base at Cobra Kai Dojo, but he quickly adopts the Cobra Kai "no mercy" philosophy. As his attitude shifts, his relationship with Samantha LaRusso deteriorates, resulting in a violent rivalry with Johnny's estranged son, Robby Keene.</p>

			<h3> Johnny Lawrence</h3>
			<p>Johnny was once the troubled rich kid of the Valley who began a thirty-year feud with the new kid Daniel LaRusso. John Kreese's vicious martial arts training made him a formidable opponent, and he was the top student at the Cobra Kai dojo. After losing the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament, Johnny's life was turned upside down and remained that way throughout his adulthood, and he became Robby Keene's estranged father. Johnny reopens Cobra Kai Dojo and becomes a sensei to an entirely new generation of students in an attempt to reclaim his life.</p>

			<h3> Daniel Larusso</h3>
			<p>Daniel was a troubled high school student whose life was changed when he learned great life skills and self-defense from a knowledgeable karate sensei. Daniel used his martial arts training to protect himself and others, winning two consecutive karate championships and defeating his tenacious opponents.</p>
